# Timeline UI by Ketchup

Timeline UI taken inspiration from online sources and coded by me.

### Tech
 Timeline UI open source projects to work properly:
  - Skeleton Framework from http://getskeleton.com/
  - Jquery
  - Jquery Ease from http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
  - Font-Icons from http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/

###How To Use

Elements that you use for a left and right columns (sections)

div.row.t-row > div.six.columns 

For the icons you should add inside 

div.six.columns > div.icon-column > i (font awesome fonts) 

For seperators you should add between rows

div.row > div.seperator > icon or text goes here

And if you want to use scroll animation to seperators

Add attribute "to" spans inside of menu div to go seperators and they need "data" attribute

You should have something like menu > span to="Seperator1"

For seperators have like row of seperator have data="Seperator1"



### Todo's (will add feature)

Design for sections , Fixed menu , Scroll optimize for devices and more ...
